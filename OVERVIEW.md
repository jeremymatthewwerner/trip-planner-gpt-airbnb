# Trip Planner GPT Project Overview

## 1. Project Goal

The Trip Planner GPT project aims to create an intelligent travel planning assistant that combines the power of GPT models with real-world travel data. The system helps users plan their trips by:

- Finding suitable accommodations through Airbnb integration
- Providing real-time pricing and availability information
- Offering a clean, modern interface for travel planning
- Supporting natural language interactions for travel queries
- Maintaining deep links to booking platforms for seamless user experience

## 2. Architectural Overview

### FastAPI Backend Server
- Core API server built with FastAPI for high performance and modern Python features
- RESTful endpoints for accommodation searches and travel planning
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- CORS support for frontend integration
- Environment-based configuration management

### RapidAPI Integration
- Integration with RapidAPI's Airbnb API for real accommodation data
- Fallback system to mock data when API is unavailable
- Standardized URL construction for deep linking to Airbnb listings
- Rate limiting and error handling for API calls

### Data Models
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Structured data models for accommodations
- Type hints and validation throughout the codebase
- Consistent error response formats

### Mock Data System
- Realistic mock data for development and testing
- Automatic fallback when external APIs are unavailable
- Consistent data structure matching real API responses
- Easy switching between mock and real data

### Deployment Infrastructure
- Render.com for API hosting
- Environment variable management for sensitive data
- Production-ready configuration
- Static site hosting for documentation

### Security Features
- API key management through environment variables
- CORS configuration for security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure handling of sensitive data

## 3. Implementation and Deployment Steps

### Initial Setup
1. Created FastAPI application structure
2. Implemented basic endpoints and data models
3. Set up development environment with virtual env
4. Added dependency management with requirements.txt

### API Integration
1. Integrated RapidAPI's Airbnb endpoint
2. Implemented error handling and logging
3. Created mock data system for development
4. Added URL construction for deep linking

### Deployment Process
1. Set up Render.com account and configuration
2. Created render.yaml for deployment settings
3. Configured environment variables:
   - RapidAPI key
   - Other service credentials
4. Set up continuous deployment from GitHub

### Testing and Validation
1. Implemented endpoint testing
2. Validated API responses
3. Tested error handling
4. Verified mock data system

### Documentation
1. Created comprehensive README
2. Added API documentation
3. Included setup instructions
4. Documented environment variables

### Security Implementation
1. Set up secure key management
2. Implemented input validation
3. Added error handling
4. Configured CORS policies

## Current Status

The project is fully functional with:
- Working Airbnb integration
- Deployed API endpoint
