# Trip Planner GPT Project Overview

## 1. Project Goal

The Trip Planner GPT project aims to create an intelligent travel planning assistant that combines the power of GPT models with real-world travel data. The system helps users plan their trips by:

- Finding suitable accommodations through Airbnb integration
- Providing real-time pricing and availability information
- Offering a clean, modern interface for travel planning
- Supporting natural language interactions through a custom GPT
- Maintaining deep links to booking platforms for seamless user experience
- Leveraging OpenAI's GPT platform for intelligent trip planning

## 2. Architectural Overview

### FastAPI Backend Server
- Core API server built with FastAPI for high performance and modern Python features
- RESTful endpoints for accommodation searches and travel planning
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- CORS support for frontend integration
- Environment-based configuration management

### RapidAPI Integration
- Integration with RapidAPI's Airbnb API for real accommodation data
- Fallback system to mock data when API is unavailable
- Standardized URL construction for deep linking to Airbnb listings
- Rate limiting and error handling for API calls

### OpenAI GPT Integration
- Custom GPT created through ChatGPT UI
- Configuration stored in `gpt_config` directory
- Integration with our Render-hosted API
- Natural language processing for travel queries
- Intelligent trip planning suggestions
- Context-aware travel recommendations

### Automation Framework
- Playwright-based automation scripts in `automation` directory
- Designed to automate GPT configuration on OpenAI platform
- Initial work on automating steps not available via API
- Framework for future automation expansion
- Currently pending authentication solution

### Data Models
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Structured data models for accommodations
- Type hints and validation throughout the codebase
- Consistent error response formats

### Mock Data System
- Realistic mock data for development and testing
- Automatic fallback when external APIs are unavailable
- Consistent data structure matching real API responses
- Easy switching between mock and real data

### Deployment Infrastructure
- Render.com for API hosting
- Environment variable management for sensitive data
- Production-ready configuration
- Static site hosting for documentation

### Security Features
- API key management through environment variables
- CORS configuration for security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure handling of sensitive data
